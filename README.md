# es6-intentions-intelliJ
Proof of concept, testing jetbrains plugin development

Version 0.1

This plugin adds two refactor options for: convert to/from arrow function. 
It performs a few validations and only takes care of the sintax change, version 0.2 will manage "this" and "arguments" keywords (if possible).

Use at your own risk! 
Possible outcomes include: broken code, stupid code, fire, death.
